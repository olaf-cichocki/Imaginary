This is still work in progress, and in no way production-ready. This package will be a library to handle media in Cloudinary. For now, take a look at the other packages:

- [Cloudex](https://github.com/smeevil/cloudex)
- [Cloudinex](https://github.com/veverkap/cloudinex)

## Installation

The package can be installed by adding `imaginary` to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

```elixir
def deps do
  [
    {:imaginary, "~> 0.0.2"}
  ]
end
```

The docs can be found at [https://hexdocs.pm/imaginary](https://hexdocs.pm/imaginary).
